Note, I know this probably isn't the best way to generate a notebook that displays resume elements,
but I thought it'd be fun to do this with actual code.

This file of helper functions allows the notebook to be cleaner and allowed for me to have some fun with import statements.

def display(type, plain_format=False):
    '''
    Returns a dict for work experience, education, or projects based on what type was requested.

    Change plain_format to True for the function to actually print the text.
    It's set to False by default so that I could display the text with some Markdown formatting instead of the plain print output.
    It's recommended to delete the duplicate Markdown cells if toggling this to True.
